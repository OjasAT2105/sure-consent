# Privacy Preference Modal Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The privacy preference modal was not opening in both the admin preview area and the frontend when users clicked on the "Preferences" button.

## Root Causes Identified

1. The PreferencesModal component wasn't properly handling the isOpen state changes
2. Event handlers in PreviewBanner and PublicApp components weren't properly memoized
3. The modal state management wasn't consistent between admin and frontend
4. Missing proper callback functions for onClose and onSave events

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. PreferencesModal.jsx

- Added proper useCallback for event handlers (handleAcceptAll, handleRejectAll, handleSavePreferences)
- Improved state management for categories and cookies
- Ensured the component properly responds to isOpen state changes
- Added useEffect to reset expanded category when modal closes
- Fixed the conditional rendering to ensure the modal appears when isOpen is true

### 2. PreviewBanner.jsx

- Added useCallback for all event handlers (handleAccept, handleDecline, handlePreferencesClick, handleReopenBanner)
- Created dedicated handler functions for modal close (handleModalClose) and save (handleModalSave)
- Ensured proper state transitions when opening/closing the modal
- Fixed the button click handlers to properly hide the banner and show the modal

### 3. PublicApp.jsx

- Added useCallback for all event handlers (handleAccept, handleAcceptAll, handleDecline, handlePreferencesClick, handleReopenBanner)
- Created dedicated handler functions for modal close (handleModalClose) and save (handleModalSave)
- Ensured proper state transitions when opening/closing the modal
- Fixed the button click handlers to properly hide the banner and show the modal

### 4. Test File

- Created test-modal-fix.php to verify the fix works in both admin and frontend environments
- Added the test file inclusion commented out in the main plugin file for future testing

## Testing Verification

The fix has been implemented to ensure:

1. The modal opens correctly in the admin preview when clicking the Preferences button
2. The modal opens correctly in the frontend when clicking the Preferences button
3. State transitions work properly (banner hides when modal opens, settings button shows when modal closes)
4. All event handlers are properly memoized for performance
5. The component properly responds to settings changes

## Files Modified

- src/components/PreferencesModal.jsx
- src/components/PreviewBanner.jsx
- src/public/PublicApp.jsx
- sure-consent.php (added test file inclusion commented out)
- test-modal-fix.php (new test file)

## How to Test

1. Uncomment the test file inclusion in sure-consent.php
2. Visit the admin area and show the preview banner
3. Click the Preferences button and verify the modal opens
4. Visit the frontend of the site
5. Click the Preferences button and verify the modal opens
6. Check browser console for success/failure messages

## Notes

The fix focuses on proper state management and event handling to ensure consistent behavior between admin preview and frontend implementations.
