# Custom Cookie Display Fix Summary

## Issue Description

Custom cookies created in the "Create Custom Cookies" section were not appearing in the privacy preference modal (both in admin preview and frontend). The cookies were being saved correctly but not displayed in the modal.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by inconsistent use of category identifiers:

1. Custom cookies were being saved with category **IDs** (e.g., "essential", "functional")
2. But in some parts of the code, particularly when transferring cookies between categories, the system was using category **names** instead of IDs
3. This created a mismatch where cookies had category IDs but the filtering logic was looking for category names

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. CreateCustomCookies.jsx

- Fixed category dropdown to use `category.id` instead of `category.name` as the option value
- Ensured consistent use of category IDs when creating new cookies

### 2. CookieCategories.jsx

- Fixed cookie transfer functionality to use category IDs instead of names
- Updated all functions that handle cookie category changes to use consistent ID-based references
- Fixed category selection dropdown in transfer dialog to use `category.id` as value

### 3. Data Consistency

- Ensured all components use category IDs consistently:
  - PreferencesModal.jsx (already correct)
  - PublicApp.jsx (already correct)
  - PreviewBanner.jsx (already correct)

## Key Changes Made

### File: src/components/CreateCustomCookies.jsx

```jsx
// BEFORE (incorrect):
<option key={category.id} value={category.name}>
  {category.name}
</option>

// AFTER (correct):
<option key={category.id} value={category.id}>
  {category.name}
</option>
```

### File: src/components/CookieCategories.jsx

```jsx
// BEFORE (incorrect):
const cookieCount = getCategoryCookieCount(category.name);
const categoryId = deleteDialog.category.name;

// AFTER (correct):
const cookieCount = getCategoryCookieCount(category.id);
const categoryId = deleteDialog.category.id;
```

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. Create a custom cookie in the "Create Custom Cookies" section
2. Select a category from the dropdown (should show category names but use IDs internally)
3. Save the cookie
4. Open the privacy preferences modal in both admin preview and frontend
5. The custom cookie should now appear in the appropriate category accordion

## Testing

A test file `test-custom-cookie-display.php` has been created to verify:

- Custom cookies are saved with correct category IDs
- Cookie categories have proper ID/name structure
- Matching between cookies and categories works correctly

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- Custom cookies created in admin will appear in privacy preferences modal
- Both admin preview and frontend will show the same custom cookies
- Cookie category filtering works correctly using consistent ID-based matching
